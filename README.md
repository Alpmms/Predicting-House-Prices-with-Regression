# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression

In this project, we’ll explore a dataset containing information about various houses (features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). Our goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on these features. We’ll use linear regression, a simple yet powerful algorithm for regression tasks.
